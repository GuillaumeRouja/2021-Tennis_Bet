OBJECTIVE: 'Build a profitable Tennis betting algorithm'

Build a binary classification model that returns the probability for player A or player B to win. Assess both male (ATP) and female (WTA) players.

Check the prediction against the most profitable bookmakers and calculate the expected profit:

A. Build some confidence metrics -> ratio between our win probability and the bookmaker win probability.

B. Set a solid threshold (avoiding overfitting as much as possible) to tell on which game we want to bet.

C. Forecast and plot the expected profit on the games we have selected to bet on.
